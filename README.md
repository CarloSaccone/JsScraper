# Js Scraper

A test repo to try the puppeteer library for scraping

## Rule finder

The idea is to create an injectable script to enable a WYSIWYG ruleset creator to allow users to point an element in the page and tag it at with a label.

## Server

The server should be able to read rulesets and scrape data using the given rules

yarn install
node server.js
